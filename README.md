In the development of the application, two main actors were identified: a state-certified laboratory and end users, which may include consumers, the state and traders who buy olive oil. The latter acquire olive oil from the producers with a view to securing an agreement that is fully transparent and ensures fair pricing for each party. Eleven quality parameters have been defined as part of the quality assurance of olive oil. 
1) Acidity
2) Κ268
3) Κ232
4) Median of defects
5) Polyphenol content
6) alpha-tocopherols (vitamin E)
7) Pesticide residues
8) Insecticide residues
9) Plasticizers
10) Dehydrated sterols (adulteration index)
11) Celsius temperature at the time of oil extraction
